# Clustering Analysis: Identifying MLB Hitter Types Through Swing Metrics

This repository is for CSAS-2025-Data-Challenge.

In this repository, we used R to conduct an in-depth analysis of batting data from the MLB 2024 season, we focused on and wanted to observe and look for patterns of interaction between pitchers and batters by analyzing the two variables, bat speed, and swing length, to identify key factors that affect the outcome of the game, in more detail we chose the first part. “Batter-specific batting discipline. Can bat speed and swing length be used to measure certain aspects of batting discipline? Does this data help analyze a batter's decision to swing at a ball? For example, are faster hitters more patient? Is bat speed or swing length related to a batter's ability to hit two strikes or protect home plate? “These questions are used to build a systematic process for analyzing baseball data through data import, initial exploration, data preprocessing with derived variables, visualization, statistical tests to machine learning methods (PCA with clustering), and interactive analysis of actual game results.

Our main focused research question is how can we use bat speed and swing length data to identify and carve out different styles of batter types and evaluate the impact of these differences on batting effectiveness in pitching interactions such as two-strike protection, strikes with fringes, and varying pitch speeds and ball types?

 - The data we use is `statcast_pitch_swing_data_20240402_20241030_with_arm_angle.csv`, which is the data of the MLB 2024 season from Statcast.
 - The file "code" include all the code we used for the analysis.
 - The folder "image" include all the plot we generated.
